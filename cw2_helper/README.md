## Question 3
All the codes are written as methods in the class `YoubotIkine.cpp`. 

## Question 4 (trajectory planning in Joint and Cartesian space)
Depending on the preferred visualisation tool, at the end of the launch command, specify `rviz:=true` to use rviz, or `gui:=true` to use default Gazebo GUI.
  * (a) Launch using `roslaunch cw2_helper q4a.launch`
  * (b) Launch using `roslaunch cw2_helper q4b.launch`
  * (c) Launch using `roslaunch cw2_helper q4c.launch`
  * (d) Launch using `roslaunch cw2_helper q4d.launch`

## Question extra (shortest path)
Depending on the preferred visualisation tool, at the end of the launch command, specify `rviz:=true` to use rviz, or `gui:=true` to use default Gazebo GUI.
  * (e) Launch using `roslaunch cw2_helper q_extra.launch`
